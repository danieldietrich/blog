Hi guys, as I mentioned in a [previous post](https://danieldietrich.dev/blog/2023/12/13/drawing-a-clear-line/), I have redirected my energy from maintaining the Vavr project towards other activities. It seems that many people are uncertain about the future of Vavr. Please allow me to clarify a few things.

The current state of Vavr 0.10.4 is feature-complete. There are no plans for new features. Personally, I will not continue to comment on issues, review and merge pull requests, fix bugs, or release new versions. I have also discontinued maintaining the website and the documentation.

The 1.0.0-alpha releases are early-stage spikes that never reached a stable state. Please do not use them at all; essentially, all of them are broken. These alpha releases are not compatible with the 0.10.x releases.

There was an idea to transfer the ownership of the Vavr project to the Eclipse Foundation, and I searched for a new maintainer. Some people showed interest and were willing to take over the project. Here are my thoughts on that.

Transferring the ownership of the Vavr project to the Eclipse Foundation will not solve the challenge of finding a new maintainer. The Eclipse Foundation is a legal entity that provides governance and infrastructure for open source projects. It does not provide maintainers.

In fact, the location of the source code is irrelevant. The source code is publicly available, and I encourage you to fork the project and continue development on your own. The Vavr project is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license, so you are free to do so.

I really appreciate the offers from those who showed interest in taking over the project. After some consideration, I decided to freeze the project instead of transferring ownership. I will keep the name Vavr and the domain for personal use.

The reason for this is that the project deserves a fresh start instead of being kept in maintenance mode. I am convinced that the project will benefit from a new maintainer who is willing to bring it to the next level.

A new maintainer needs to be passionate about functional programming and have experience with Java. More importantly, a new maintainer needs to create a vision for the future of Vavr. Besides being able to communicate that vision to the community, tangible results need to be achieved. That will take time and energy.

I encourage you to prove that you are the right person to take over the project.
