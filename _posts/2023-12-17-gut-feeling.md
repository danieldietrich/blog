I believe that we all have antennas and that decisions can be made without engaging our brain in intense thinking about which direction to take.

We travel on a time-based path, in one direction&mdash;at least that's how I experience it within my reality[^1]. On a high level, my mental model of life is that we are in a maze resembling a tree. Each moment, we stand at the root of the tree[^2] and can only move forward in time, down the tree. At each actual root, there are an infinite number of branches, but we can only traverse one branch at a time[^3].

This is overwhelming&mdash;we need to make decisions about which branch to pursue. We can't see the entire tree, yet we might glimpse a few branches ahead. Although everything is interconnected, this fact doesn't necessarily simplify matters for us, right? We can never truly predict the outcome of taking a certain branch. We are left to guess, to use our intuition, our gut feeling[^4], in decision-making.

Everyone has a gut feeling, yet not everyone listens to it. Over time, it seems we lose the connection to ourselves. What if depression is the inner self's attempt to capture our attention? Could it be that we are depressed because we're not heeding our gut feeling?

A good way to reconnect with our gut feeling is to meditate. I would describe meditation as the practice of broadening our focus and quieting our thoughts. It is a means of returning to the present moment.

I am fond of the notion of being guided in life[^5] and trusting that everything will work out fine. Such trust alleviates anxiety and is the key to living a happy life. It also helps us reconnect with ourselves and the universe.

[^3]: A decision may be instantaneous because we must choose between an infinite number of branches.
[^4]: Often, things turn out differently than one might think.
[^5]: I describe myself as non-religious, but I am drawn to the idea of a higher power, which could be an inner power within us all, the universe, or a concept of god. Based on my current understanding, nothing cannot exist; otherwise, I would not be here, so there must be something.

We travel on a time based path, in one direction, at least I experience it as such in my reality[^1]. On a high level, my mental model about life is that we are in a maze that can be seen as a tree. Each _moment_, we are at the root of the tree[^2] and we can only move forward in time, down the tree. At each actual root, there are an infinite number of branches, but we can only move down one branch at a time[^3].

This is overwhelming&mdash;we need to make decisions about which branch to take. We can't see the whole tree, but we can see a few branches ahead. All is interconnected, that doesn't make it easier for us, right? We can't really know what will happen if we take a certain branch. We can only guess. We can only use our intuition, our gut feeling[^4], to make a decision.

Everyone has a gut feeling but not everyone is listening to it because it seems to be a matter of time that we loose the connection to ourselves. What if depression is all about the innerself trying to get our attention? What if we are depressed because we are not listening to our gut feeling?

A good way to get back in touch with our gut feeling is to meditate. I would describe meditation as widening our focus and thinking about nothing. It is a way to get back to the present moment.

I like the idea of being led in life[^5] and having the trust that everything will turn out fine. That removes anxiety and is the key to live a happy life. It also connects us to ourselves and to the universe.

[^3] A decision might be instaneous because we need to _choose_ between an infinite number of branches.
[^4] First of all, things turn out differently and, secondly, than one thinks.
[^5] I would describe myself as non-religious but I like to believe in a higher power, maybe that is an inner power that we all have, the universe, or god. As of my current understanding, there can't be nothing, otherwise I would not exist, so there must be something.
