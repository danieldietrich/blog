I know that Vavr is important to many of you, and I have already received feedback on my last post, [Statement on Vavr's Future](https://danieldietrich.dev/blog/2024/06/07/statement-on-vavrs-future/). After considering the options to better serve the Vavr community, I am happy to announce that I will be offering sponsored work on Vavr.

This means you can hire me to work on Vavr features, bug fixes, or documentation. Additionally, I will provide consulting services for Vavr.

Please feel free to contact me for more information.

Thank you!
