Dear Vavr Community, it is with a mix of nostalgia and excitement that I write to you today. After years of developing and maintaining Vavr, our beloved functional programming library for Java, I have made the significant decision to transfer the ownership of the project to a new maintainer.

Vavr started as a simple idea to bring the power and elegance of functional programming to the Java ecosystem. Over the years, it evolved into a robust and influential library, benefiting many developers around the world. Your unwavering support, contributions, and feedback have been instrumental in shaping Vavr into what it is today. For that, I am deeply grateful.

As many of you know, I have not been as actively involved in the project in recent years. During this period, I contemplated various paths for Vavr's future, including the possibility of moving the project to the Eclipse Foundation, continuing as the sole maintainer, or adding a paywall to sustain its development. After careful consideration, I realized that the best way to ensure the project's continued growth and vitality was to pass the torch to someone with fresh energy and vision.

I am pleased to announce that the new maintainer of the Vavr project is [Grzegorz Piwowarek](https://github.com/pivovarit). He brings a wealth of experience, passion, and exceptional engagement in the Java community. Grzegorz is an active community member, serving as the Warsaw Java User Group Leader and contributing to several program committees, including JDD, 4Developers, and BuildStuff. His deep involvement with Java spans over a decade, and his early talks often revolved around functional programming, fostering a close relationship with the project since the release of Java 8. I am confident that under his leadership, Vavr will continue to thrive, innovate, and remain an indispensable tool for the Java development community.

This transition is not the end, but rather a new chapter in the journey of Vavr. I will be onboarding Grzegorz and providing him with a helping hand during this transition period. Over time, I plan to gradually phase myself out to ensure a smooth and sustainable handover. I believe that Grzegorz will introduce new ideas, improve existing features, and lead the project to new heights. I encourage you all to extend your support and collaboration to him as generously as you have to me.

Thank you once again for your trust, dedication, and contributions to Vavr. Let us continue to build a vibrant and dynamic community around this incredible library.

With gratitude and best wishes,

Daniel
