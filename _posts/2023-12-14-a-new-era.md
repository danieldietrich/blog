Good morning!

I recognize two kind of developers, those who are curious about the new tools and those who have negatively connotated thoughts and draw themselves out of AI topics, back into their mental comfort zone, in order to feel safe[^1].

Yes, I am team _new tools_. After I had clarified all my questions and cleared my doubts out of the way, I needed access to the best model available. ChatGPT Pro [actually costs][chatgpt-pricing] $20 per person/month[^2].

Then I [found][pay-as-you-go] a better option and used OpenAI API, the platform for developers. The [pricing][openai-pricing] is more flexible, we get enterprise grade security features, are on the bleeding edge and can use the latest and greatest preview models before they are made publicly available to the masses.

(_Without a valid use case, a tool is just a toy._)

ChatGPT is text-in-text-out. If we put shit in, we will get shit out, it depends on our [prompting][prompting]. The quality of an answer can be refined by creating so-called GPTs, those are [assistants][assistants] with initial instructions[^3], a little bit like role playing.

For example I created two assistants, a lawyer for general contracts and a principle software engineer. The lawyer helped me finding certain strategies in the field of contracts and solving questions that arised between different parties. The priciple software engineer assists me when it comes to finding solutions for programming topics and for quickly learning new topics.

Assistants have two useful options, Code Interpreter and Retrieval. When Code Interpreter is enabled, our assistant can perform exact calculations for us, e.g. cost calculations. The Retrieval option allows us to feed our assistant with context in form of documentation[^4]. Please note that we get the best solutions from our assistants by refining the outcome in a chat.

Yesterday for example I freed 20% of my iCloud space by compressing all .pdf files. I try to avoid paper, scan most of my personal documents and store them in my iCloud. Often these documents are disproportionately big and I use online services to shrink their size&mdash;a time consuming manual workflow.

GPT assisted me to create a shell script that finds all .pdf files in a folder structure, compresses them, shows the sizes and the compressions ratio and finally removes the originals. The solution is mainly based on Ghostscript. For convenience reasons I want to show you the script for compressing .pdf files[^5] below.

I must admit that I am more than impressed by this awesome new technology&mdash;no doubt, it ushers in a new era.

CODE OMITTED

[^1]: Of course there are always some in-between, who observe and have their thoughts. A little bit like the [Mandelbrot set][mandelbrot], some are inside and some are outside&mdash;and we do not known much about those on the boundary.
[^2]: In a professional settings ChatGPT Enterprise is a must because of security.
[^3]: Assistant instructions are also called _system prompt_, a prompt that is executed before our _user prompt_.
[^4]: A GPT can read various file formats, like PDFs, Word documents and Excel Sheets.
[^5]: Ghostscript must be installed manually, e.g. by running `brew install ghostscript` on macOS.

Good morning!

I recognize two kinds of developers: those who are curious about new tools, and those who harbor negatively connoted thoughts, withdrawing from AI topics to retreat back into their mental comfort zone, in order to feel safe[^1].

Yes, I am on the new tools team. After I had clarified all my questions and dispelled my doubts, I needed access to the best model available. ChatGPT Pro [actually costs][chatgpt-pricing] $20 per person/month[^2].

Then I [discovered][pay-as-you-go] a better option and used the OpenAI API, the platform for developers. The [pricing][openai-pricing] is more flexible; we get enterprise-grade security features, are on the cutting edge, and can use the latest and greatest preview models before they are made publicly available to the masses.

ChatGPT is text-in, text-out. If we put garbage in, we will get garbage out; it depends on our [prompt design][prompting]. The quality of an answer can be refined by creating so-called GPTs, those are [virtual assistants][assistants] provided with initial instructions[^3], a bit like role-playing.

For example, I created two assistants: a lawyer for general contracts and a principal software engineer. The lawyer helped me find certain strategies in the field of contracts and solve questions that arose between different parties. The principal software engineer assists me with finding solutions for programming topics and quickly learning new subjects.

Assistants have two useful features: Code Interpreter and Retrieval. When the Code Interpreter is enabled, our assistant can perform precise calculations for us, e.g., cost calculations. The Retrieval feature allows us to feed our assistant with context in the form of documentation[^4]. Please note that we get the best solutions from our assistants by refining the outcomes in a dialogue.

Yesterday, for example, I freed up 20% of my iCloud space by compressing all .pdf files. I try to avoid paper, scan most of my personal documents, and store them in my iCloud. Often these documents are disproportionately large, and I use online services to reduce their size&mdash;a time-consuming manual workflow.

GPT helped me to create a shell script that finds all .pdf files in a folder structure, compresses them, displays the sizes and the compression ratios, and finally removes the originals. The solution is primarily based on Ghostscript. For your convenience, I want to show you the script for compressing .pdf files[^5] below.

(_Disclaimer: My Copywriter assistant corrected this post[^6]._)

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define the function to compress pdf and calculate the ratio
compress_pdf() {
    # Define the function to calculate the ratio inside
    compression_ratio() {
        original_size=$1
        compressed_size=$2
        ratio=$(echo "scale=2; $compressed_size / $original_size * 100" | bc)
        echo "$ratio"
    }

    original_file="$1"
    compressed_file="${original_file%.pdf}-compressed.pdf"

    # Perform the compression with Ghostscript
    if gs -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dCompatibilityLevel=1.4 -dPDFSETTINGS=/ebook -dNOPAUSE -dQUIET -dBATCH -sOutputFile="$compressed_file" "$original_file";
    then
        original_size=$(stat -f%z "$original_file")
        compressed_size=$(stat -f%z "$compressed_file")
        ratio=$(compression_ratio "$original_size" "$compressed_size")

        # Output: original and compressed sizes and the compression ratio
        echo "File: $original_file, Original Size: $original_size bytes, Compressed Size: $compressed_size bytes, Compression Ratio: $ratio%"

        # Remove the original file
        rm "$original_file"
    else
        echo "Error: Ghostscript failed to compress $original_file" >&2
    fi
}

# Make sure the script can be sourced to define the function in subshells
if [ "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" == "${0}" ]; then
    find . -iname '*.pdf' ! -iname '*-compressed.pdf' -exec bash -c 'source "${0}" && compress_pdf "$@"' "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" {} \;
fi
